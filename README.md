## 🧠 What is PTSD?

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a serious mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. It affects **millions of people worldwide** and is one of the most underdiagnosed and undertreated mental health conditions.

### Key Statistics

- **~70%** of adults worldwide experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetime
- **~20%** of those who experience trauma develop PTSD
- **8 million** adults in the US alone are diagnosed with PTSD each year
- PTSD affects **veterans, abuse survivors, accident victims, first responders**, and anyone who has faced severe trauma
- Only **~50%** of people with PTSD ever seek treatment — largely due to stigma, lack of access, and unawareness
- Untreated PTSD leads to depression, substance abuse, relationship breakdown, and in severe cases, suicide

### Common PTSD Symptoms

- **Re-experiencing**: Flashbacks, nightmares, intrusive memories
- **Avoidance**: Staying away from people, places, or thoughts related to trauma
- **Hyperarousal**: Being easily startled, difficulty sleeping, irritability
- **Negative cognition**: Guilt, shame, emotional numbness, detachment
- **Dissociation**: Feeling disconnected from reality or one's own body

---

## 💡 The Problem We're Solving

Mental health support for PTSD is:

- **Expensive** — therapy sessions cost $100–$300/hour
- **Inaccessible** — long waitlists, limited therapists in rural areas
- **Stigmatized** — many people avoid seeking help due to social shame
- **Reactive** — most tools only help during a crisis, not proactively

**MindGuard bridges this gap** — providing a science-backed, always-available, private, and compassionate digital companion for PTSD recovery and daily mental wellness.

## 🌍 Impact & Vision

### Why This Matters

- PTSD is a **global health crisis** affecting soldiers, abuse survivors, refugees, accident victims, and everyday people
- The **treatment gap** is enormous — most people never get help
- Mobile-first mental health tools have shown **clinically significant results** in multiple studies
- Apps like MindGuard can serve as a **bridge** between crisis and professional care

### What Makes MindGuard Different

- **Holistic approach** — not just one tool, but a complete ecosystem
- **Evidence-based** — every feature is grounded in clinical research (CBT, DBT, somatic therapy, binaural science)
- **Privacy-first** — no cloud dependency, no data harvesting
- **Beautiful UX** — mental health apps should feel calming, not clinical
- **Emergency-ready** — one-tap access to crisis resources at all times
- **Offline-capable** — works without internet, critical for users in crisis
